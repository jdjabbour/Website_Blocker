# This is a quick how-to for setting up your blocker to run when 
# your system boots up.
# !! MAKE SURE TO BACKUP ANY AND ALL FILES BEFORE IMPLEMENTING!!

# Windows - any version
 ** Make sure curser is on a new line at the end of the Host file
 ** Need to be admin to run due to changing the host file
 ** Change the extention from .py to .pyw
 ** when changed you can then double click the name of the program and it will
      run from windows exporer and not command line.
 ** You can see that it is running in the task manager
 ** Go to task scheduler - create a task - configure for W7 - run with highest 
     privilages (admin)
 ** Trigers - new - Begin the task - from dropdown select Startup
 ** Actions - new - start a program - select your app
 ** save
 ** From here you should be able to see your app run upon your system starting
      up.

# Linux and Mac
 ** Use the CRON service to schedule your application
 ** Make sure your curser is at a new line in the hosts file. /etc/hosts
 ** sudo crontab -e (need to use sudo since this will need sudo privileges)
 ** at the end of the file enter:
    @reboot python3 /path/to/file/blocker.py
